my Webapp has 5 pages in total, each linking to one another.
the homepage uses bootstrap and a list to go to other pages, and a few css properties.
page 1 has an image and uses a media query print.
page 2 has a table and a stylesheet.
page 3 has media query for smaller screen size and uses sass nesting.
page 4 uses css selectors and properties.
page 5 uses sass variable and inheritance and also a bootstrap grid.
